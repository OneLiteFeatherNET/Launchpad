# Component Design Guide for OneLiteFeather Blog

This document outlines the design principles, patterns, and best practices for creating and maintaining components in the OneLiteFeather blog project.

## Component Organization

Components in this project are organized into the following categories:

### Base Components

Located in `/components/base/`, these are the foundational UI elements that are used throughout the application. They should be:

- Simple and focused on a single responsibility
- Highly reusable
- Customizable through props
- Styled consistently with the design system
- Accessible by default

Examples include buttons, inputs, cards, and navigation elements.

### Feature Components

Located in `/components/[feature-name]/`, these components are specific to a particular feature or section of the application. They may:

- Compose multiple base components
- Contain business logic specific to a feature
- Be less reusable across the application

Examples include blog post cards, comment sections, and feature-specific forms.

### Layout Components

Located in `/layouts/`, these components define the overall structure of pages. They should:

- Define the overall page structure
- Handle responsive layout concerns
- Provide consistent spacing and alignment

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `NavigationBar.vue`, `BlogPostCard.vue`)
- Be descriptive and specific (e.g., use `NavigationSimpleButton.vue` instead of just `Button.vue`)
- For base components, consider prefixing with the component type (e.g., `BaseButton.vue`, `BaseInput.vue`)
- For feature components, prefix with the feature name (e.g., `BlogPostCard.vue`, `BlogCommentSection.vue`)

## Component Structure

Each Vue component should follow this general structure:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Template code here -->
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
// Imports
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

// Props
const props = defineProps({
  // Define props here
})

// Emits
const emit = defineEmits([
  // Define emits here
])

// Refs and reactive state
const localState = ref(null)

// Computed properties
const derivedValue = computed(() => {
  // Compute value based on props or state
})

// Methods
function handleEvent() {
  // Handle event and possibly emit
}

// Lifecycle hooks if needed
onMounted(() => {
  // Mounted logic
})
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Component-specific styles */
</style>
```

## Props and Events

- Use typed props with validation where possible
- Provide default values for optional props
- Document props with comments
- Use events (emits) for communicating with parent components
- Follow a consistent naming pattern for events (e.g., `update:modelValue`, `click`, `submit`)

Example:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const props = defineProps({
  /** The text to display on the button */
  text: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  /** Whether the button is in a loading state */
  loading: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
  },
  /** The button variant (primary, secondary, etc.) */
  variant: {
    type: String,
    default: 'primary',
    validator: (value: string) => ['primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary'].includes(value)
  }
})

const emit = defineEmits(['click', 'focus', 'blur'])
</script>
```

## Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling when possible
- For complex components, consider using scoped CSS
- Follow the project's color palette and design tokens
- Ensure responsive design for all components
- Use CSS variables for theming and consistent values

Example:

```vue
<template>
  <button 
    class="px-4 py-2 rounded-md font-medium transition-colors"
    :class="[
      variant === 'primary' ? 'bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700' : 
      variant === 'secondary' ? 'bg-gray-200 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-300' :
      'bg-transparent text-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-50'
    ]"
    @click="emit('click', $event)"
  >
    <slot></slot>
  </button>
</template>
```

## Component Documentation

Each component should include:

- A clear description of its purpose
- Documentation for all props, events, and slots
- Usage examples
- Any special considerations or limitations

Consider using JSDoc-style comments for props and methods to enable better IDE integration.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep components focused**: Each component should have a single responsibility.
2. **Composition over inheritance**: Compose complex components from simpler ones.
3. **Avoid direct DOM manipulation**: Use Vue's reactivity system instead.
4. **Minimize side effects**: Components should be predictable and avoid unexpected behavior.
5. **Test components**: Write unit tests for components, especially for complex logic.
6. **Consider performance**: Be mindful of expensive operations and unnecessary re-renders.
7. **Internationalization**: Use the i18n system for all user-facing text.
8. **Accessibility**: Follow accessibility best practices (see the Accessibility Guide).

## Technical Details

The component system in this project uses:

1. Vue 3 with the Composition API and `<script setup>` syntax
2. TypeScript for type safety
3. Tailwind CSS for styling
4. Nuxt 3 framework features like auto-imports
5. i18n for internationalization

By following these guidelines, we ensure a consistent, maintainable, and high-quality component library for the OneLiteFeather blog.
