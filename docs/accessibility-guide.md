# Accessibility (a11y) Guide for OneLiteFeather Blog

This document outlines the accessibility standards, best practices, and implementation guidelines for the OneLiteFeather blog project to ensure that the website is usable by people of all abilities and disabilities.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites. It also benefits others, including older people with changing abilities. At OneLiteFeather, we are committed to creating an inclusive experience for all users.

## Standards We Follow

Our accessibility implementation is guided by:

- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, Level AA compliance
- **WAI-ARIA 1.1**: For enhanced accessibility of dynamic content and advanced user interface controls

## Key Accessibility Principles

### 1. Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

#### Text Alternatives
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content (images, icons)
- Use the `alt` attribute for images
- Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for interactive elements without visible text

```vue
<!-- Good example -->
<img src="/logo.png" alt="OneLiteFeather Logo">

<!-- For decorative images -->
<img src="/decorative-image.png" alt="">
```

#### Time-based Media
- Provide captions and transcripts for audio and video content
- Ensure media controls are keyboard accessible

#### Adaptable Content
- Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Ensure content is readable when stylesheets are disabled

#### Distinguishable Content
- Make it easy for users to see and hear content
- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
- Don't use color alone to convey information
- Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality

### 2. Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

#### Keyboard Accessibility
- Ensure all functionality is available using a keyboard
- Avoid keyboard traps
- Implement logical tab order
- Provide visible focus indicators

```vue
<!-- Good example: Custom button with keyboard support -->
<div
  role="button"
  tabindex="0"
  @click="handleAction"
  @keydown.enter="handleAction"
  @keydown.space="handleAction"
  class="focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
>
  Click me
</div>
```

#### Enough Time
- Provide users enough time to read and use content
- Avoid time limits or provide options to extend time
- Allow users to pause, stop, or hide moving content

#### Seizures and Physical Reactions
- Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions
- Avoid content that flashes more than three times per second

#### Navigable
- Provide ways to help users navigate and find content
- Use descriptive page titles
- Implement proper heading structure
- Provide skip links to bypass repetitive content

```vue
<!-- Skip link example -->
<a href="#main-content" class="sr-only focus:not-sr-only">
  Skip to main content
</a>
```

### 3. Understandable

Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable.

#### Readable
- Make text content readable and understandable
- Identify the language of the page and any language changes

```vue
<html lang="en">
  <!-- For language changes within the page -->
  <p>English text <span lang="de">Deutscher Text</span></p>
</html>
```

#### Predictable
- Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
- Maintain consistent navigation
- Do not initiate changes of context automatically

#### Input Assistance
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes
- Label form elements clearly
- Provide error messages that identify the error and suggest corrections
- Offer validation before form submission

```vue
<!-- Good form example -->
<div>
  <label for="email" class="block text-sm font-medium">Email</label>
  <input 
    id="email" 
    type="email" 
    aria-describedby="email-error"
    :aria-invalid="hasError"
  >
  <p id="email-error" v-if="hasError" class="text-red-500">
    Please enter a valid email address
  </p>
</div>
```

### 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

#### Compatible
- Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents
- Use valid HTML
- Ensure proper ARIA usage
- Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies

## Implementation Guidelines for Components

### Buttons and Interactive Elements

- Use native buttons (`<button>`) when possible
- Ensure custom interactive elements have appropriate ARIA roles
- Provide keyboard event handlers for custom controls
- Ensure adequate touch target size (at least 44x44px)

### Forms

- Associate labels with form controls using `for` and `id` attributes
- Group related form controls with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`
- Provide clear error messages and validation
- Use `aria-required` for required fields
- Implement `aria-live` regions for dynamic form feedback

### Navigation

- Use semantic elements like `<nav>`
- Implement ARIA landmarks
- Provide clear, descriptive link text
- Indicate current page/section in navigation

### Images and Media

- Always provide alt text for images
- Use empty alt text for decorative images
- Provide captions and transcripts for media
- Ensure media controls are accessible

### Tables

- Use proper table markup with `<th>`, `<caption>`, etc.
- Use scope attributes to associate headers with data cells
- Avoid using tables for layout purposes

### Dynamic Content

- Use ARIA live regions for content that updates dynamically
- Ensure modals and dialogs are properly implemented with focus management
- Provide ways to pause or stop animations and carousels

```vue
<!-- ARIA live region example -->
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
  {{ notificationMessage }}
</div>
```

## Testing Accessibility

Regular accessibility testing should be part of the development process:

1. **Automated Testing**: Use tools like axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse
2. **Keyboard Testing**: Ensure all functionality works with keyboard only
3. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
4. **Color Contrast Testing**: Verify all text meets contrast requirements
5. **Zoom Testing**: Test at 200% zoom level
