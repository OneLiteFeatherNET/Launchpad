# Code Improvements for Maintainability

This document outlines the improvements made to the codebase to increase maintainability using Nuxt 3 features and structures.

## 1. Shared Composables

### useProjectStatus Composable

Created a shared composable for project status handling to eliminate duplicate code in components:

```typescript
// composables/useProjectStatus.ts
export const useProjectStatus = () => {
  // Map status strings to translation keys and colors
  // ...
  
  return {
    getStatusTranslationKey,
    getStatusColor,
    isStatusInCategory
  };
};
```

This composable centralizes status-related functionality that was previously duplicated in multiple components, making the code more maintainable and consistent.

## 2. TypeScript Type Definitions

### Shared Type Definitions

Created shared type definitions for project-related entities:

```typescript
// types/project.ts
export interface Project {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  status: ProjectStatus;
  // ...
}

export interface RoadmapItem {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: ProjectStatus;
}
```

These shared type definitions ensure consistency across components and provide better type safety and IDE autocompletion.

## 3. Component Refactoring

### ProjectDetails Component

Refactored to use the shared composable and type definitions:

```typescript
import type { Project } from '~/types/project';

defineProps({
  project: {
    type: Object as () => Project,
    required: true
  }
});

const { getStatusTranslationKey, getStatusColor } = useProjectStatus();
```

### ProjectRoadmap Component

Refactored to use the shared composable and type definitions:

```typescript
import type { RoadmapItem } from '~/types/project';

const props = defineProps({
  roadmap: {
    type: Array as () => RoadmapItem[],
    required: true
  }
});

const { getStatusColor } = useProjectStatus();
```

## 4. Nuxt 3 Features Utilized

### Auto-imports

Leveraged Nuxt 3's auto-import feature for composables, eliminating the need for explicit imports in components.

### TypeScript Integration

Improved TypeScript integration with proper interfaces and type definitions, enhancing code quality and developer experience.

### Modular Structure

Organized code in a more modular structure with shared types and composables, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## 5. Code Cleanup

- Removed German comments and replaced them with English comments
- Simplified complex conditional logic in templates
- Improved code organization with proper separation of concerns

## 6. Testing

Created a test page (`/test-project-components.vue`) to verify that the components work correctly with the new changes.

## Conclusion

These improvements have made the codebase more maintainable, type-safe, and aligned with Nuxt 3 best practices. The code is now more modular, reusable, and easier to understand and extend.
