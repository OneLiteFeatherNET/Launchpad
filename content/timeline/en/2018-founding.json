  "content": "In 2018, we founded our first Minecraft server. What began as a small project among friends would become the foundation for today's OneLiteFeather Network.\n\nWe started with a simple survival server that could only host a few players at a time. The technical infrastructure was still very limited, but the enthusiasm and commitment were great from the beginning.\n\nDuring this early phase, we experimented a lot and learned many things that formed the basis for our later developments. The first self-developed plugins arose from the necessity to have certain functions that didn't exist yet.",
