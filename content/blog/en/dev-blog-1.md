### Sentry
Sentry is used for automatic error tracking for us.
With this we are hoping that we actively see a bug or error, produced by users, in productive and test environments, which could not be covered by Quality Assurance (QA) or which is a special case.

Advantages:
- Automatic notification of live and test systems when bugs or errors are produced.
- Stacktraces are saved central and connected to the project in Gitlab.
- Errors / bugs are recorded with the matching version to sort out priorities. These can be interpreted in our project management to filter out if this error / bug was already fixed in an earlier version.

### SonarQube
SonarQube is used by us for first layer feedback, it checks our source code via CI/CD active for safety, orientating on industry standards. We can take sure with this software that our source code quality stays constant. Simple mistakes can be excluded with SonarQube.

Advantages:
- Automatic and neutral feedback for the developer
- The project lead or lead developer only needs to help on the second layer (or step) which saves time for us.
- Constant source code quality

---
### Gitlab
Gitlab is our central source code management platform which allows us to roll out automatic updates with CI/CD workflow on several environments. It helps us to coordinate software. Gitlab gives us the possibility for metric integration on several enviroments as well. At the moment we are using the fork function to build projects based on equal data structures to use first settings which are important.

Advantages:
- Automatic setup by CI/CD workflow
- Big time saving while setting up the project
- Equal structures to save learn time to work with the project
- Dependency updates are quicker through central template management
